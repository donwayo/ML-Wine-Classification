Description:

In order to predict the wine type, we use the gradient descent method for multivariable classification. We perform cross-validation, splitting the dataset into training set (70%) and validation set (30%).  We are trying to find the right weights that will minimize our error function, so in every iteration we recalculate the derivative function of  the error to derive smaller theta’s until our error function converges to its minimum. The probability of a sample of being white or red is estimated using the sigmoid function and for our prediction we define that if the probability is larger than/equal to 0.5, then the sample is white, otherwise it’s red.
