To calculate the wine type, we use naive bayesian binary classification. As for the quality classification, we split the dataset into training set (70%) and validation set (30%). We calculate the maximum likelihood estimator for the prior probability, the mean and the standard deviation of both red and white samples, and use them to calculate the discriminant function. The discriminant funciton gives us the probability of a sample being red or white wine. We classify the validation set according to which discriminant is bigger and calculate the error by estimating the mean square error of our prediction with the true values from the validation set. The only drawback for this algorithm is that it takes one feature into consideration to classify the type.

For the quality, ...
